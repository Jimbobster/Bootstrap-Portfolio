# Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description
For this assignment named Unit 3 Challenge: Code Bootstrap Portfolio, I improved on my previous portfolio by building this code following the Bootstrap CSS Framework. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

When the page is loaded, you will be presented with a website containing my portfolio. There is a navigation bar along the top of the page, containing links that are applicable to my portfolio:

<li>When you click the Navigation Bar links, then you are taken to the appropiate section of the website.

Below the navigation bar there is a hero section (jumbotron) containing a photo of me, and my job role.

The next section contains my work in a grid, using bootstrap cards for each project. There is a short description giving a brief overview of the project. Below the description is a clickable button:

<li>When you hover over the buttons, then the box displays a shadow upon hover and also underlines the link.

<li>When you click the project button links, then you are directed to the deployed application or repository.

Below the work area lies my skills section, listing some of the skills I expect to learn from this bootcamp within an un-ordered list.

Underneath the skills area, I added an "About Me" and "Contact Me" section in the same row. The "Contact Me" section has two hyperlinks for emailing me and acccessing my LinkedIn profile:

<li>When you hover over a hyperlink, then the hyperlink will display a different colour upon hover.

<li>When you click the hyperlinks, then you are directed to email me, and my LinkedIn Profile.

I added a footer section at the bottom, containing a navigational link which takes you back to the top of the page when clicked.
